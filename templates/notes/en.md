## Notes
- I'm not responsible for any damages caused by using this avatar.
- This avatar is designed for work with no resource pack and no other mods are installed. An unexpected issue may occurs when you use it with any resource packs and mods (texture and armor inconsistencies, etc.). However, I may not support you in these cases.
- There may be a bug which occurs in multiplayer because my ([Gakuto1112](https://github.com/Gakuto1112)) multiplayer environment to verify the avatar is insufficient.
- Please [report an issue](https://github.com/<!-- $REPOSITORY_NAME -->/issues) if you find it.
